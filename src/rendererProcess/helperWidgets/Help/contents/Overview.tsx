            TDM is a display manager for the <LINK link={"https://epics-controls.org/"}>EPICS</LINK> control system.
            It runs on x86 or ARM computers with Windows, macOS, or Linux operating systems.
            With TDM, you can create, edit, and operate graphical user interfaces to monitor and control EPICS channels (process variables).
            The software is designed for flexibility and ease of use, supporting both simple and complex control system configurations.
        </P>
        <P>
            In TDM, EPICS channels are monitored and controlled using a variety of widgets arranged within display windows.
            You can easily organize these widgets by dragging and dropping them to create intuitive layouts tailored to your needs.
            For complex control systems, multiple windows can be opened and managed simultaneously.
            The graphical user interface in TDM is defined by JSON-style <code>.tdl</code> files.
            Although these files can be edited as plain text, it is recommended to use TDMâ€™s built-in editor to ensure consistency and compatibility.
        </P>
        <P>
            At the top level, users can create and manage multiple profiles,
            each representing a distinct EPICS environment with its own site-specific variables.
            Profiles are stored as JSON files and can be easily browsed or edited using TDM's built-in GUI tools.
            This enables seamless switching between environments such as development, testing, and production.
        </P>

        <P>
            Each display window in TDM operates as an independent process, taking advantage of modern multi-core architectures to improve both performance and reliability.
            This design allows TDM to handle large and complex control systems efficiently, ensuring that each window can operate without affecting the others.
            The TDM main window provides an overview of all open windows, allowing users to quickly access and manage them.
            This feature is particularly useful for systems with multiple display windows, as it simplifies navigation and enhances user experience.
        </P>

        <P>
            TDM offers a variety of tools to improve the efficiency of operation, enabling users to work more effectively with EPICS channels.
            One particular goal is to minimize the need for users to remember specific channel names,
            allowing them to focus on the task at hand rather than memorizing technical details.
            For example, <LINK widget={widget} to={"/Tools/Probe"}>Probe</LINK> provides
            detailed information about the PV. The <LINK widget={widget} to={"/Tools/DataViewer"}>Data Viewer</LINK> tool displays data history effectively.
            The <LINK widget={widget} to={"/Tools/ChannelGraph"}>Channel Graph</LINK> is a GUI tool for analyzing and visualizing relationships between channels.
        </P>

        <P>
            TDM includes advanced features to enhance flexibility and control.
            <LINK widget={widget} to={"/AdvancedTopics/Rules"}> Rules </LINK> and
            <LINK widget={widget} to={"/AdvancedTopics/PythonScript"}>Python Script</LINK> allow users to process data and dynamically control widget behavior at runtime.
            The <LINK widget={widget} to={"/AdvancedTopics/LocalPv"}>Local PV</LINK> feature lets you create local variables for custom data manipulation and workflow optimization.
        </P>
        <P>
            TDM can seamlessly open <LINK widget={widget} link={"https://github.com/gnartohl/edm"}>Extensive Display Manager</LINK> (EDM)
            files (<code>.edl</code>), preserving both the appearance and functionality of the original screens.
            <code>.edl</code> files are automatically converted to TDM format on-the-fly, with conversion times ranging from less than a second to several seconds depending on file complexity.
            For batch conversions, TDM also provides a standalone tool, <LINK widget={widget} to={"/Tools/FileConverter"}>File Converter</LINK>, to efficiently convert multiple <code>.edl</code> files to <code>.tdl</code> format.
        </P>
